== Description ==

MyCurator supports your content curation process by using AI techniques to weed out 90% or more of the articles in 
your feeds, alerts and blogs, saving you hours every day. 

MyCurator started as a hosted offering for businesses who provided targeted articles and insights to their 
customers to drive engagement and customer retention.  As a Wordpress plugin, MyCurator connects to the same 
cloud process that powers the hosted business sites.  This allows MyCurator to maintain a low processing overhead 
on your blog.

* After training, you will typically see only 5 to 10 good articles out of 100 read by MyCurator
* Training is simple with a click of a thumbs up or thumbs down on each article
* Works with any RSS source of articles including google alerts, blogs, news feeds even twitter searches
* Targeted news feeds and twitter searches can be created with MyCurator from within WordPress
* You can choose to automatically have the good articles posted to a specific category on your blog.
* Or you may choose to manually curate the best insights from the articles into your own blog posts.
* Each article is saved as a readable page, like Instapaper, using Diffbot technology.

MyCurator is free for individuals, bloggers and non-profits, but you will have to obtain an API Key to access the 
cloud services.  For businesses, those promoting products and higher volume users, low priced monthly plans are
